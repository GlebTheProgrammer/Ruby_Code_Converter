# Ретранслятор под Ruby

This program was developed by me for the analysis of small, simple programs written in the Ruby programming language. 

The program is able to determine the complexity of the program by calculating the number of operators and operands in the code. 

You can use the program on relatively small programs (200 - 300) lines of code. Otherwise, processing and computation may take longer period of time.

Enjoy :)
